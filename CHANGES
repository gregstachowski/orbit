orbit.c from orbit.c.5
----------------------

1. External estimrho().
2. Iterative Kepler solution multiplied by 100 to avoid small number
   subtraction (no apparent effect, however). (Also in a few other functions).
3. Lower difference threshold in Kepler solution: 1e-6 not 1e-6.
4. General tidying up, -Wall warning fixes.
5. Use of dot() for scalar multiplication.
6. Leuschner correction numbers explicitly written out.

gauss2.c vs. gauss.c
--------------------

gauss2 uses pointer arithmetic and eleiminates unecessary printfs, gauss.c 
uses array notation.
